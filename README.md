# House_Price_Pred_Project
Predicting the price of house based on different inputs

Here's a beginner-friendly `README.md` file for your **House Price Prediction with Streamlit** project:


# 🏠 House Price Prediction App

This is a beginner-friendly end-to-end machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, presence of a basement, guestroom, and more. It includes:

- Data preprocessing in Jupyter Notebook  
- A linear regression model using scikit-learn  
- A deployed interactive web app using **Streamlit**

## 📊 Features Used in Model

* `price`: Target variable (what we're predicting)
* `area`: Square feet
* `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
* `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
* `stories`: Number of stories
* `mainroad`: Is the house on a main road? (yes/no)
* `guestroom`: Has a guestroom? (yes/no)
* `basement`: Has a basement? (yes/no)
* `hotwaterheating`: Has hot water heating? (yes/no)
* `airconditioning`: Has air conditioning? (yes/no)
* `parking`: Number of parking spaces
* `prefarea`: Located in a preferred area? (yes/no)

All categorical variables were converted to binary using `yes → 1` and `no → 0`.



##  ML Model

* **Model Used**: Linear Regression
* **Library**: `scikit-learn`
* The model was trained in `house_price_mini_project.ipynb` and saved as `model.pkl` using `pickle`.
